# About Us

**One Fourty Games** was created by two friends who studied Computer Engineering together and share a long-standing passion for video games. We are a new indie developer driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to build games from the inside out.

We create games because we genuinely love gaming. Not trends. Not hype. Games.

Our focus is simple: **games to disconnect and enjoy**. Experiences designed for pure entertainment, without unnecessary complexity. We believe games should feel good to play — smooth, satisfying, and engaging.

What makes us different is how we build. We don't just assemble mechanics — we design and develop our own gameplay systems, difficulty algorithms, and progression logic to explore how games can better adapt to players. Each project is also part of our journey to learn the industry deeply, technically and creatively.

This is just the beginning. Our long-term goal is to grow into a professional studio and create high-quality, large-scale games — but always keeping the same mindset that started it all: two friends who love making games people enjoy playing.
