# Why Mobile Puzzle Games Are Actually Good for Your Brain

*Published on May 15, 2025*

In a world full of digital distractions, mobile games often get a bad rap. "It's just a waste of time," they say. But science begs to differ—especially when it comes to **puzzle games**.

Games like **[Block Crash](https://onefourtygames.github.io/#/games/block-crash)** aren't just about killing time; they are a gym for your brain.

## 1. Spatial Reasoning Training
When you play a block puzzle game, you are constantly rotating shapes in your mind and visualizing where they fit best. This activates the **parietal lobe**, the part of your brain responsible for spatial awareness.

> **Did you know?**
> Studies have shown that regular engagement with spatial puzzles can improve your ability to navigate the real world, read maps, and even pack your suitcase more efficiently!

## 2. Dopamine and Stress Relief
Solving a puzzle or clearing a line releases a small hit of **dopamine**—the "feel-good" neurotransmitter. Unlike the frantic stress of action games, puzzle games often induce a "flow state," akin to meditation.

This helps lower cortisol levels (stress hormone), making games like Block Crash a perfect way to unwind after a stressful day of work.

## 3. Improving Short-Term Memory
Remembering which pieces are coming next and planning your board requires **working memory**. By keeping track of the grid state and potential moves, you are actively strengthening your brain's short-term memory capacity.

## Conclusion
So, next time someone tells you to put the phone down, you can tell them you're training your brain.
